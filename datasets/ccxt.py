# Could maybe pull data from ccxt (https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt), for more data but this is not necessary for the project.
# The same library would also allow you to actually trade but that might be another project in itself.
# This project is more as a proof of concept and to learn about trading strategies and how to implement them.
